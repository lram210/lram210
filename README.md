Hello! My name is Luis Ramos and I am a mostly self-taught programmer pursuing a Bachelors in Physics (2023 Grad).

I want to become a software engineer for industry experience before going back to school
for my PhD in electrical engineering.

I'm currently doing all I can to improve my coding (Python, Java/Javascript, HTML/CSS, etc.), so here exist projects 
I completed via online tutorials or did on my own.

You can reach me at tonyramos2001@gmail.com
